With suboptimal insurance, finding a provider, especially with the competition there is for mental health services in this area, is next to impossible. As someone who can be, when motivated, resilient when faced with obstacles/barriers, I have been shocked by the level of difficulty it has taken me to find support. 'Difficult' is an understatement. The 'available providers' lists given by insurance companies are rarely (if ever) updated. The majority of clinicians do not respond, do not have availability as is specified by the providers list, and the process becomes 'a numbers game' in that services found, I'd imagine, are correlated to how 'thick your skin can be' due to the absurd amount of rejection/resistance one must face to receive any type of treatment. Regarding University Healthcare Services, the price that is charged to students in need is obscene. For those of us lucky enough to be on the bottom rungs of society, we're expected to fork over ~3-4k yearly when government programs exist that are free? Financial aid money, which already isn't anywhere near enough to manage finances in this area (a 1 bedroom apartment is 2100-2400 monthly not including the barrage of other expenses needed to survive), shouldn't be a considered 'a luxury to have' within the budget that's provided. I have had to repeatedly find alternative health care access--not because I've wanted to--but due to the excessive cost of services provided and the severe financial burden this area puts on most students.
